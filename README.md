# MeetMinder
Application Prototyping using Adobe XD and Software Engineering design methods including full SRS Document

<h1>MeetMinder</h1>

A full semester project from my CSIS 521 course at Saginaw Valley State University which I had a lot of fun with.  Working with my teammates, we created MeetMinder, a team gathering app that tracks each user's whereabouts and allows meetings to take place more efficiently with notifications and GPS tracking.

The app prototype GUI was built using Adobe XD.  Full documentation and design files are included.  This incluces a full Software Requirement Specification document and Use Case scenarios.  You can see the linked prototype here:
